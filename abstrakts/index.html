        <h2>About AbstraktS</h2>
        <p class="poem">
            <i>
                Deep down in Paris suburb close to Brie-Comte-Robert,
                <br />
                Way back down in the Forest of Notre-Dame,
                <br />
                There stood a sad village made of churches and pubs
                <br />
                Where lived two country punks named [Shimyo] and Antoine Portes,
                <br />
                Who never ever learned to play or sing quite well
                <br />
                But they could handle a beer and liked to brag about it.</i></p>
        <p class="bio">
            Well that was about ten years ago: our two teenage punk rockers teamed up in a bunch of bands to express the violence that was tormenting their drunken souls (some evidences of these somber times remain <a href="https://archive.org/details/cum_41-des_fleurs_sur_un_tas_de_merde" target="_blank" title="Des Fleurs sur un tas de merde : Cum 41 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive" type="text/html" rel="external" hreflang="en">here</a>) before growing apart until Moira united them again. This happened by the end of the cursed year 2020 and sounded a bit like "Holly shit! You're still alive? — Barely! You? — How 'bout some old-fashioned noise?".
            <br />
            <br />
            In the meantime, Shimyo had been digging a deep grave into the underground, changing pseudonyms more often than underwear, and thus becoming the anonymous prophet of the mole-people, the muse with a thousand names, the turbulent light in the blind cavern. He hadn't quitted music of course. Apart from being a raper/beatmaker, he had nourrished a sick passion for acousmatic experiments and flourished amongst the death rattles of broken machines.
            <br />
            <br />
            Antoine Portes, on the other hand, had fallen to the very edge of society, crawling homeless, friendless, jobless... everythingless (ecxept for music of course). That is until he met his soulmate who put a drop of lust for life into his veins and made him rise again as the poison in the capitalist machine: a music composer for a greedy devil known as <i>Television</i>. Due to his extreme bareness, he had to learn how to make music whithout instruments: his new weapons were stolen pencils and recycled paper.
            <br />
            <br />
            So here we are, after ten years of silence, with a new rhapsody trying to merge our parallel lives with our common nostalgy. Enjoy it folks, see you in another ten years!
